Application Program Interface :
	It is a way for two computers to talk to each other over the web.
Example :
	 A delivery app can use the Google Maps API to support location tracking instead of building one 
from scratch.


REST API : An API that follows the REST standard is called RESTful API.Here is a good example when designing and using a RESTful API using the example of a
survey app.

	1.Basic format
	2.HTTP verbs
	3.URL endpoints
	4.Status codes
The format of a RESTful API has three main components: 1) URL endpoint; 2) HTTP verb
	URL endpoint: Is a URL link that represents the resources we want to access. Resources can be text, images, documents or any data entry. 
		For example, 
			example.com/surveys allows us to view or create survey templates and 
			example.com/surveys/123/responses allows us to do the same for all responses of survey 123.
	HTTP verb: Tells the server what we want to do with the URL endpoint resource. 
		For example, 
			POST request means we want to create a new survey template and a
 			GET request means we want to view an existing survey template.
Request:
		GET http://example.com/surveys/123/responses
Response:
// HTTP status code: 200
{
  survey_id: 123,
  survey_title: "nps onboarding survey",
  responses: [
  {
    response_id: 42,
    nps_score: 9,
    feedback: "love the service",
    respondent_id: 42
  }
  ...
 ]
}

2.HTTP verbs
There are 5 basic verb commands when making a HTTP request:

GET: make a read only request to view either a single or list of multiple resources
POST: creating  a new resuource.
DELETE: destroy the given resource based on the id provided
PUT: update the entire fields of the resource based on the given body of the request or create a new one if not already exist
PATCH: update only the fields of the resource if it exists.

This is commonly referred to as a CRUD application.

3.URl endpoint :
	A URL endpoint in a RESTful API represents any given object, data or service the API can access. 
For example, 
	example.com/surveys represents all the survey templates and 
	example.com/surveys/123/responses the data for all responses of a given survey.

4.Status Codes :
Upon receiving a HTTP request in the basic RESTful format the server will return a HTTP status code along with any optional JSON payloads. 	

	200 OK             Request was successful.
	401 Unauthorized   Server requires authentication.
`	404 Not Found      Page not found
